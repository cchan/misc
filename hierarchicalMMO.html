/* HIERARCHICAL MMO - with a dynamic, non-strictly-defined hierarchy
The philosophy is that it should work like capitalism - not strictly defined, but promoting sophisticated structures anyway.
"Chain of Command"

GAME MECHANICS
	STARTING
	Everyone starts with their own ragtag military unit, starting with like 5 varied individuals but can increase
		morale - if you risk yourself your unit will fight harder (!= better, but yes) but you can die and you thus lose the game
		individuals - smart enough to go get food when needed, follow rules and orders, etc.
	hm gender balance?
	each individual will have their own set of characteristics that influences how they respond to you, how they fight, how quickly they learn, etc.
		each individual also has their own weapon(s), backpack of supplies and stuff, etc.

	OFFLINE
	You can tell your units to set up camp and then you can leave the game
		there is no day and night, only online and offline
	Reasonably powerful defense (can set up stakes and stuff even if offline)
		also, there are minor morale penalties for attacking someone who's offline.

	CIVILIANS
	Civilian units are very weak AIs with like 5 people contained in each. Since they don't have a commander, they can be forcibly captured and taken control of, unlike user units.
		At that point you can let them fight for you (you need to find weapons and stuff, and they start off extremely weak)
		Or, you can let them do manual labor for you (like collecting/carrying food, etc.)
		Or you can kill them, but every kill decreases morale (well, there are massive bonuses for killing generals and stuff), and these kills are accomplishing nothing.
	If your unit has enough morale and power and niceness (not massacres - this connects to morale), civilians will want to join you.
		(this is also an order - command your subordinates to accept/reject volunteers, or even conscript)

	FOOD & SUPPLIES
		can gather, can take from civilians, can carry to other parts of the army
		(supply lines!! - the land relatively quickly regenerates food, though)
		weapons -- can buy from a blacksmith, can hire (food for him and family) a blacksmith, can kill a blacksmith

	COMMAND
	You can invite units to be subordinate to your unit, and then you can issue complex orders to them (via click/drag or even chat)
	When you receive orders, you still do as you think best; they have no control over your units normally
		With your permission, your commander can transfer direct control of your unit to himself or to another subordinate
	2nd 3rd 4th in command for when the commander is offline
	Even when you're commander you still only are you, so you'll always be in 3rd person limited perspective behind your character and unit.

	BATTLE
	When you kill the commander of a unit, and they're not extremely loyal to him (high morale), his unit's individuals will defect to you.

	DIPLOMACY
	Direct chat meeting if you're close enough
	Sending peaceful envoys (white flag and all) to get close enough to start a direct chat meeting - can kill the envoy, and the chat connection ceases :D :D
		It's not specifically called an Envoy, but it's just a weaponless single person carrying a white flag.

TECH
	PRELOADING
	look at minecraft's way of doing it
	
	GRAPHICS
	I really don't want to go there. Squares circles triangles? - I need a professional graphics designer/programmer - can sell to EA/Blizzard/Steam/stuff :)
		Minecraft graphics yay lol
